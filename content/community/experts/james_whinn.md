**James Whinn**, CTO of [Expert Thinking](https://expert-thinking.co.uk), is an industry certified expert with comprehensive experience helping organisations succeed in their digital transformations. With exposure to such a wide range of sectors, including highly regulated industries such as finance and pharmaceuticals, James is well rehearsed in the common pitfalls facing companies when it comes to adopting cloud-native technologies and how to overcome them.

As an advocate of Internal Developer Platforms, James believes that IDP's are key to an organisations ability to compete in the age of software. James goes further to suggest that often, in times where companies across all sectors are increasingly adapting to become technology companies, that the difference between success or falling behind the competion is often the successful adoption of an IDP which enables the organisation to deliver on its business outcomes.
