# Nitric

Nitric is an [open-source](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric) Infrastructure in Code software tool that provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) workflow to automate the provisioning of resources for managed services such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. Nitric automatically generates a specification of resources required by an application and leverages IaC tools such as Pulumi or Terraform to fulfill the resource request. Nitric simplifies the provisioning process by allowing you to focus more on the application development and less on the specific details of each cloud.
