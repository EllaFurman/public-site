## **What is Port?** [#](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/developer-portals/port/#what-is-port)

Port is a platform for building no-code, holistic, Internal Developer Portals. Port’s software catalog covers microservices, resources, custom assets and fits any data model, with in-context maturity scorecards. Its portals support any developer self-service action and workflow automation.

Blueprints, or custom entity definitions, are the center of Port. They support the representation of any asset in Port, such as microservice, environment, package, cluster, databases etc. This means that Port is un-opinionated and supports any portal for any use case: Enable developers in your organization through a self-service portal for your IaC solution or any other toolset you use. Full kubernetes portal covering services, pods, clusters and more kubernetes objects, allowing for full K8s object visibility and custom developer views. Cloud resource catalog e.g. for AWS add data about Lambda functions, S3 buckets, SQS, ECS services etc. Support GCP too. Github catalog data from git providers that will populate the blueprints, creating a software catalog with the right abstractions, permissions and more.

Port’s software catalog acts as a single source of truth and is always up to date. It can be used as part of workflows, automations and CI/CD processes. All the data in Port, from CI/CD to K8s data and any extension is searchable, creating numerous inputs for workflow automation.

Port both updates other systems and allows workflows (such as CI) to check its catalog. Port also supports a UI-based developer self-service that’s loosely coupled with the underlying platform and easy scorecard creation to set engineering standards from DORA metrics to health checks, production readiness, and reliability.
