What is configure8?
---------------------
configure8 is an enterprise-grade Internal Developer Portal used for:
- Cataloging everything
- Achieving high standards
- Accelerating velocity via self-serve actions

Help your developers move faster and build better software with self-serve access to the knowledge and functionality they need.

configure8 core features include:

**Universal Catalog:** A complete and accurate software catalog is the foundation of your portal. It should organize your entire ecosystem – all your services and their dependencies, environments, clusters, resources, pipelines, metrics, owners, and more – and automatically reflect changes. Use it to improve your developers experience, and lay the foundation to achieve high standards.

**Scorecards:** Establish meaningful standards for your organization leveraging configure8's ability to observe over 40 metrics (and growing rapidly), provide developers with an at-a-glance understanding of what needs to be done to improve, and measure progress as well as keep everyone informed, all programmatically without writing scripts, maintaining spreadsheets, and chasing people down.

**Self-Serve Actions and Scaffolder:** Easily build reusable golden paths that enable developers to create new services as well as manage existing ones in the IDP via a no-code UI. Liberate developers from bottlenecks and manual ops, and reduce your maintenance overhead and TicketOps burden, all without sacrificing standards.

**Limited Set-Up and Maintenance Effort:** Single-click integrations, no YAML, manual plugin configuration, or agent required. Can self-populate services and dependencies via supported tools. Automatically maps resources to environments and services. Avoids drift and maintains accuracy via supported tools.

### What is the mission and vision of configure8?
We're on a mission to help developers move faster and build better software via self-serve access to the knowledge and functionality they need.

### A brief history of configure8
configure8 was founded in 2021 and launched our product in 2022. configure8 support multiple enterprise customers as well as rapidly growing scale-ups.

configure8 is built by engineers with backgrounds at Microsoft, Google, AWS, NASA and AOL / Yahoo! who have experienced the pain points of sprawling distributed systems. We understand the complexities of leading a team of thousands of engineers running a sprawling system inside a regulated entity because we've done it. We've experienced the stress of getting paged at 2 am for a service you know nothing about, we get the limitations of spreadsheets, scripts and static wikis, and the pain of TicketOps.
