# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

GKE is a version of Managed Kubernetes version from the creators of Kubernetes. It provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically, [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) instances) grouped together to form a [cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture).

GKE is highly recommended from a technical and reliability perspective. A downside is a tendency to enforce updates which leads to maintenance overhead, but otherwise great.
